## Project Description
This project explores the application of machine learning models for business analytics using Azure cloud technologies. The main tasks include:
- Developing an interactive web application for data analysis.
- Predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using Random Forest.
- Setting up an Azure-based web server and datastore for streamlined data loading and dashboard creation.

---

## Features
- **Write-Up on ML Models**: In-depth discussion of Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models.
- **Web Server Setup**: Deployment of an Azure-based server with user authentication.
- **Datastore and Data Loading**: Azure datastore integration for secure and efficient data management.
- **Interactive Web Page**: A user-friendly web interface for data exploration.
- **Data Loading Web App**: Simplifies data input and visualization.
- **Web Page with Dashboard**: Real-time data dashboards using Azure services.
- **ML Model Application**: Customer churn prediction and CLV analysis.

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Configure the Azure services:
    - Set up an Azure storage account for the datastore.
    - Deploy the web app using Azure App Service.

---

## How to Use
1. Register or log in to the web server (default credentials: username: `abhay`, password: `Abhay`).
2. Load data using the provided interface.
3. Interact with the web page to visualize data or run ML models.
4. Access dashboards for business insights such as CLV and churn prediction.

## ML Models
### Linear Regression
A fundamental regression model that identifies linear relationships in data.

### Random Forest
A robust ensemble model, ideal for CLV prediction due to its high accuracy and ability to handle complex data.

### Gradient Boosting
An iterative model for tasks with nonlinear relationships, offering high performance with careful tuning.
